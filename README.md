## installation instructions

download [neo4j community edition](https://neo4j.com/download/community-edition/)

open the neo4j community edition application

click "start"

when it is running, check [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474) to confirm your local database is running

it will ask you to enter the default login, user: "neo4j", password: "neo4j", and it will expect you to give a new password.

you are ready! :-)

## optional

I will be using a node.js script to speed up creating a test database. If you want to be able to run that script, then make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4.0 or greater installed. If it is, then put yourself in the bdlab-neo4j-presentation directory and run `npm install` to download the package dependencies.
